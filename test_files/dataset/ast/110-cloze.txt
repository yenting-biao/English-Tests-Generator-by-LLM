We all know that too much stress is not good for our health, but too little is not ideal, either.
While 11 stress can be dangerous to the body, short-term stress is actually healthy.
Short-term stress triggers the production of protective chemicals in our body and strengthens the
body’s defenses. 12 our body is in a vulnerable situation, a burst of stress will quickly mobilize the
body’s own repair system to defend the damaged areas. This 13 us from physical discomfort and
sickness. Small amounts of stress hormones may even sharpen our memory. A recent study found that
when rats were forced to swim—an activity that places them under stress for a short while—they
remembered their way through mazes far 14 than rats that were in a relaxed state.
The key to a healthy lifestyle is to keep our stress level 15 . Too much stress will make us
cranky and sick. Too little stress, on the other hand, will lead to boredom and low motivation.

Do you know the difference between the terms meteoroid, meteor, and meteorite in astronomy?
Many people find these words confusing. However, the difference is all about their 16 .
Meteoroids are far up in the sky. They are chunks of rock or metal that speed through space. Some
are very large and may be hundreds of feet wide. Others 17 the size of a small stone. Most
meteoroids travel around the sun in space and stay away from the Earth. However, sometimes a meteoroid
will enter the Earth’s atmosphere. Friction with the atmosphere will cause it to 18 and burn while
traveling at high speed. As a meteoroid begins to burn in the atmosphere, it leaves a streak of light. When
this tail-like light is falling down toward the Earth, it is called a meteor, or a shooting star. Most meteors
vaporize completely before they hit the ground. If any meteor 19 its fiery journey through the
atmosphere and lands on Earth, it is called a meteorite. Large meteorites can cause great explosions and
much destruction on the surface of the Earth. 20 , Barringer Crater in the American state of Arizona,
measuring 1,200 m in diameter and some 170 m deep, was produced by a meteorite impact.
