Passage:
When did people first experience the joy of the hula hoop? Although the term did not emerge until the
18th century, toy hoops twirled around the waist, limbs, or neck can be traced back to ancient times. As early
as 1000 BC, Egyptian children played with hoop toys of dried grapevine. They threw, jumped, and slung
them around their bodies as we do today. They also struck them with sticks to roll them down the road.
Hoop rolling was also popular in ancient Greece. Their hoops, often made of metal, were not merely toys
for Greek children but served as exercise devices as well.
In the 14th century, hoops were popular as a form of recreation in Great Britain. The craze for hoops
even resulted in dislocated backs and heart attacks, according to medical records. The term “hula,” however,
did not enter the English language until the 1700s, when British sailors first witnessed hula dancing in the
Hawaiian Islands. Though no hoops were used, the movements of the ritual dances looked very similar to
those in hooping. Thus “hula” and “hoop” came together, resulting in the term “hula hooping.”
Hoops spun their way through the cultures of pre-colonial America as well. Often considered as
representing the circle of life, hoops featured prominently in the ritual dances of Native Americans. Dancers
used small reed hoops as symbolic representations of animals such as eagles or snakes. With very rapid
movements, they used the hoops to construct the symbolic forms around their bodies.
The hula hoop gained international popularity in the late 1950s, when a plastic version was
successfully marketed by California’s Wham-O toy company. Twenty-five million plastic hoops were sold
in less than four months. The hula hoop “fad” is still going strong today.

Passage:
When you enjoy your morning cup of tea, you are probably not aware that those tea leaves can mean
injury, or even death, for Asian elephants roaming Indian tea gardens.
In the Indian state of Assam, growing numbers of tea farms are destroying the Asian elephant’s habitats
and endangering their population. Much of the forest land where tea is grown in Assam is flat and thus
farmers must dig drainage trenches to prevent water from accumulating and hurting the shrubs. The trenches,
however, can be death traps for the elephants. Since the elephants need to use tea plantations as landmarks
when navigating forests, they almost inevitably have to move through the farms. Moreover, because there
are fewer humans around, pregnant females often use tea-growing areas as safe shelters to give birth. But
baby elephants, not used to negotiating rough ground, may easily fall into the trenches and get hurt; and
once injured, they might not be able to climb out. When mothers try to dig their babies out, both may be
trapped and smothered by thick mud. Furthermore, elephants are known to resist leaving their sick or dying
behind, and a herd may linger at a trench with a trapped baby for hours, reluctant to move on until all hope
is lost.
Is it possible for elephants to coexist with the prosperous tea business? Elephant Friendly Tea is an
organization that takes the initiative to make it possible. The organization encourages consumers to choose
brands that take precautions to protect elephants and has set up a certification program to reward tea growers
who are doing it right. Until now, only smaller tea brands have been certified, but awareness is growing.
The organization believes that people may be motivated to buy elephant-friendly brands when they know
more about the risk tea can pose to these endangered animals.
