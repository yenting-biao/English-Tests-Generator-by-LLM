Passage:
Thomas Moran, a famous painter in the 19th century, played an important role in the establishment of
American national parks. His vivid paintings brought the splendor of the extraordinary landscapes before
the eyes of American people, thus setting the stage for the regions to be widely recognized and officially
established as national parks.
Moran came to the United States at age 7 with his family and settled in Philadelphia. They came from
northwest England, the blackened heart of the Industrial Revolution: Its main street was “a dark, unattractive
hole” and the river running through it was a string of dirty water. That was all the nature that Moran knew.
Moran began painting by age 15, inspired by the landscape paintings of the British master J.M.W. Turner.
There was plenty of landscape for him to paint in America, much different from his hometown. Showing great
talent in painting, Moran was soon hired as an illustrator at Scribner’s Monthly, and later appointed chief
illustrator by age 34. In 1871, he was appointed to illustrate The Wonders of Yellowstone, a story by Nathaniel
P. Langford, who had participated in an expedition to Yellowstone. Captivated by the utterly fantastic sights
Langford described, Moran became eager to see this odd territory for himself.
In 1871 Moran joined the first US government survey of the Yellowstone region with photographer
William Henry Jackson. For two weeks he filled his sketchbook with the landscape’s most stunning sights.
Moran’s watercolors—the first color renderings of the area—as well as Jackson’s photos and the survey
results were presented to the Congress. His powerful images of Yellowstone fired the imagination of Congress
members. In March 1872, lawmakers officially made Yellowstone a national park, the world’s first.
Before Moran arrived, Yellowstone in the popular imagination was a harsh, wild place with hot water
and steam coming out of hellish holes in the ground. Since the painter’s work appeared, Yellowstone
National Park has come to be known as a picturesque wonderland. By the time Moran died, he had painted
a dozen other areas that would become national parks or monuments.

Passage:
In 2020, Petur Oddsson, a power station worker in Iceland, was struck by a 60,000-volt current. The
electrical shock burned almost half of his body and melted layers of his skin off. Such deep and extensive
burns can be fatal. But Oddsson’s life was saved by a creative invention: transplanting codfish skins onto
human bodies.
A triumph for medical technology, Oddsson’s fish skin transplantation was actually part of the
astonishing achievement of “100% Fish,” an ambitious task in promoting environmental efficiency. The
Icelandic project, from which this pioneering procedure emerged, strives for making a fundamental
change in the marine industry. It aims to encourage full utilization of each fish caught, and to strengthen
innovation in seafood products.
Reducing waste of fish catch has become a serious issue today, when many countries are faced with
food crises. According to a 2003 study, about 60% of a codfish caught in Iceland was lost or wasted during
the production process for human consumption. Under the guidance of 100% Fish, however, Icelanders are
now using almost 95% of a cod. Cod skin, for example, is made into calcium supplement and energy drinks,
and even as material for skin transplantation as in Oddsson’s case. Dried fish heads and spines are exported
to West Africa, where they are used as the base of a protein-rich soup. Other groundbreaking products,
including Omega-3 capsules, cold virus pretreatment sprays, and dog snacks are made from what was once
cod catch detritus.
The Icelandic success is accomplished largely through cooperative efforts across various industries.
100% Fish takes the initiative to show seafood companies the importance of collaboration, and facilitate
valuable connections between fishing companies and other participants of the project, including academia,
start-ups, and research and development teams. By sharing knowledge and information, the different sectors
are able to come up with improved processing and handling, through which creation of various innovative
products was made possible. The project not only helps Icelanders to get 30% more value from each cod
than most developed countries, but also provides an effective model to promote resource efficiency
worldwide.

Questions:
1. What is the primary goal of 100% Fish?
(A) To advance ocean technology. (B) To reduce food crises worldwide.
(C) To enhance cross-industry cooperation. (D) To make the most of marine resources.
2. What does “this pioneering procedure” in the second paragraph refer to?
(A) 100% Fish’s mission. (B) Oddsson’s skin transplant.
(C) A fundamental change in seafood business. (D) A new approach to protect the environment.
3. Which of the following is true according to the passage?
(A) Iceland has increased their fish catch by 30% in the last 20 years.
(B) Petur Oddsson was an important member of the Icelandic project.
(C) Cross-field collaboration has proved to be very fruitful for 100% Fish.
(D) 100% Fish is a big international enterprise marketing seafood products.
4. Here is a sentence: “Almost nothing of a fish is left for the trash bin.”
Which paragraph is most suitable to have it as the final sentence?
(A) Paragraph 1. (B) Paragraph 2.
(C) Paragraph 3. (D) Paragraph 4.
