**Passage:**

Throughout the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st, urbanization has accelerated exponentially across the globe. This rapid and widespread movement of people from rural areas to cities has brought about significant economic opportunities and societal changes but also a myriad of challenges. As cities burgeon, they often struggle with issues such as housing shortages, increased pollution, and the strain on public services and infrastructure.

One of the most pressing concerns in urban areas is the environmental impact. The concentration of populations in cities leads to heightened energy consumption, which in turn results in increased greenhouse gas emissions. The dense urban landscape also affects local climates, contributing to the urban heat island effect, where temperatures in cities are significantly warmer than in surrounding rural areas. This phenomenon exacerbates energy demand for cooling and poses health risks to city residents, particularly the elderly and vulnerable populations.

In response to these challenges, cities globally are adopting a variety of measures to enhance sustainability and improve the quality of urban life. Green building practices, promoting public transportation, and implementing comprehensive waste management systems are some of the strategies being employed. Cities like Copenhagen and Singapore exemplify successful urban planning models that integrate green spaces, renewable energy sources, and efficient public transit networks, making them paragons of sustainable development.

The drive for sustainable cities also includes social dimensions such as ensuring affordable housing, social equity, and access to essential services. As urban populations continue to grow, it is imperative that policymakers adopt an inclusive approach that addresses the needs of all residents. This holistic perspective not only enhances the liveability of cities but also contributes to their resilience in the face of global challenges such as climate change.
