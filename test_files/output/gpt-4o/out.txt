Passage:
The Great Barrier Reef, located off the coast of Queensland, Australia, is the world's largest coral reef system. Stretching over 2,300 kilometers, it is composed of nearly 3,000 individual reefs and 900 islands, and is home to an extraordinary diversity of marine life. The reef is a popular destination for tourists, particularly for scuba diving and snorkeling, and it also provides significant economic and cultural value to Australia.

The Great Barrier Reef is not only a vibrant ecosystem, but it also plays a crucial role in the world's climate system. Coral reefs, in general, are known to be very sensitive to changes in temperature, and the Great Barrier Reef is no exception. In recent years, the reef has been severely affected by climate change, with rising ocean temperatures leading to widespread coral bleaching. Coral bleaching occurs when corals are stressed by changes in conditions such as temperature, light, or nutrients, causing them to expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, which results in the coral turning completely white.

Efforts to protect and conserve the Great Barrier Reef are ongoing. The Australian government, in partnership with various environmental organizations, has implemented measures to reduce pollution, manage fishing, and improve the resilience of the reef to climate change. Despite these efforts, the future of the Great Barrier Reef remains uncertain, with scientists warning that immediate global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is necessary to prevent further damage.
